If the initial token has expired the System Administrator will need to reissue user access to the relevant role. (This will only send an email to any user that has not activated the initial token). Forgot Password requests return a single use access token link by email to the user including a warning that the token will expire in [your configured value] and if they did not request this email to notify their system administrator. Their existing password will continue to work until they action the password reset. If the time period runs out before they click the link they will have to make another request. If the maximum requests are exceeded within the set time frame, they will not receive further reset emails. You can update settings for the access token link expiry time and the number of requests within a period (e.g. 10 requests over 24 hours) - see Password security settings Password security settings - how do I check and change these? for more information. As a system administrator you will receive notification of any user that exceeds the maximum password reset requests; this is to alert to possible suspicious activity.

This occurs when a browser password manager has saved your password from the previous rem cycle and its not matching the new password the system has given you. This can be a concern, if other users can use your PC, they have access to all your systems Solution: There are a couple of ways to deal with this: 1. Talk to us about setting up SSO for you so users don't log in via a password manager. See this article Single-Sign-On-Introduction for more information 2. Clear out the saved password from your browser (all browsers have slightly different ways of doing this, here are chromes instructions: 3. Use a different browser that you don't have password saved on - even just for the initial reset of password Comments:  Author Name: Fred Ho Section:",

Provided they enter their username correctly and their email address in the system is correct this will email a new access token link to them.

                  "chunkText": "This article outlines how to troubleshoot issues surrounding login errors to an ELMO site. There are two methods of logging into the system: Standard login where a user navigates to the login screen of your ELMO site and inputs a username and password. SSO (single sign on) where a user signs in to your identity provider and then navigates to the ELMO site where they will be granted access. This article covers the following topics: Standard Login errors Forgot password notifications Single Sign on (SSO) Login errors Standard Login errors A common error that occurs when users attempt a Standard login is the username or password is incorrect or invalid credentials. ⚠️ These kind of errors only occur when the credentials that the user has provided are not correct preventing the user from logging in to the system. When these errors occur you can use any of the following troubleshooting steps to help your end users gain access to the system. Check the User is Notified 1. Navigate to Administration &gt; General &gt; Users. 2. Search for the User by name. 3. If the user has not been notified please do so. This will generate a notification with a link that will allow the user to login and set a password for the first time. For steps on how to do this please review the article here. Correct Username Ensure that the user is providing the correct username. Note that username is not always set as a users email. As a company admin you can check the username on a users profile. 1. Navigate to Administration &gt; General &gt; Users. 2. Search for the User by name. 3. Click Edit. 4. Confirm the username set in the username field. Correct Portal Users need to ensure they are signing into the correct portal. If they have a general user account they must sign in at https://insert your site name here.elmotalent.com.au/ If the user has an onboarding user account account they must sign in to https://insert your site name here.elmotalent.com.au/onboarding/ ❗ Users should not attempt to access your site through any previous activation emails. Clear Prefilled Passwords Clear any prefilled passwords populated when the user accesses the login page as password managers or browsers may be storing pervious passwords. Have the user type in their password instead. Forgot Password Request Have the user perform a forgot password request by doing the following. 1. Navigate to the login page. 2. Click the Forgot password link. 3. Enter the accounts Email Address. 4. Click Reset Password. 5. A notification will be sent out with a link for the user to access the site and reset their password. Manual Password Reset Manually reset the users password. 1. Navigate to Administration &gt; General &gt; Users. 2. Search for the User by name. 3. Click edit 4. Click the Change Password tab. 5. Change the password associated with the users account. You can also select to notify the user or force the user to change password upon logging in. ❗ Ensure the new password is provided to your end user by a secure method as the system will not send the new password out to them. Return to table of contents Forgot password notifications If a user has made forgot password request and they have not received the notification please ensure that you check the following to troubleshoot. Check in the users junk/spam folder fore the notification. Check notification History to confirm if a notification has been generated. Reach out to your internal IT team to confirm if these emails have been quarantined. If they have please ensure your email provider and any security measures are configured to allow these notifications into your employees inboxes. Check that the user has been notified in your system. 1. Navigate to Administration &gt; General &gt; Users. 2. Search for the User by name. 3. If the user has not been notified please do so. This will generate a notification with a link that will allow the user to login and set a password for the first time. For steps on how to do this please review the article here. Check that the user is making the forgot password request from the correct portal. ❗ Users must make a forgot password requests from https://insert your site name here.elmotalent.com.au/ if they have a general user account. If the user has an onboarding user account they must request from https://insert your site name here.elmotalent.com.au/onboarding/ Users should not attempt to access your site through any previous activation emails. Return to table of contents Single Sign on (SSO) Login errors Users may encounter errors when logging in using your Single Sign on provider. The two common types of errors that can occur are: Users have been blocked or are not members of a group with access and cannot sign on. ⚠️ This error only occurs when the user has not been setup correctly with your identity provider to allow access to your ELMO site. Please reach out to your internal IT team for assistance to resolve this. A user has successfully authenticated with your identity provider but their details could not be found in your ELMO site. ⚠️ This error occurs when the attribute that is being passed from your Identity provide does not match with any user account within your ELMO site.Please review the users account and your SSO settings to confirm what value is being passed and confirm this matches the value in the ELMO field this is being compared within. If you are unsure which field is being matched against please raise a support ticket and a team member will be able to confirm this for you.

                  "chunkText": "Scenario A user is having issues accessing the Remuneration system, e.g. has tried logging in but can’t, or has locked themselves out. Possible Reasons They have forgotten their password They entered the wrong username They entered the wrong password They have tried to log in too many times They’ve asked for too many Forgot Password requests They are clicking on an expired access token link They haven't received an email They are using the wrong Remuneration system link Their browser has timed out or cached to a login page that is no longer valid You've not issued user passwords to allow users to access Steps Check the flowchart and text below to work your way through the troubleshooting process. Don't forget, ELMO Support can’t reset individual passwords or access any user details. Make sure you have issued user access and you’re familiar with your system security settings. If the user has forgotten their password, they should enter their username and click on the Forgot password link. Check the Login Attempt History and Forgotten Password reports in the Standard Reports step to view user activity against your system security settings. Login Attempt History - This report shows all login attempts and whether they are successful or failed - you’re looking for a failure reason for the user who has contacted you. Most often the reason for failure will be either entering the wrong password (ask them to make a Forgot Password request and reset their password) or entering the wrong username (advise the user of their correct username using the Data Amend screen). Forgot Password – This report shows all forgot password requests – you can match these against your security settings to see if the user has exceeded the maximum attempts in the time period and locked their account. Note: No forgotten password emails will be sent once a user gets to this limit. Have they locked themselves out? If the user has entered the wrong log in information multiple times they may be locked out. Advise them to wait the lockout time period before attempting to log in again. Has the access token they’re clicking on expired? Tokens only last for a limited time period (the actual duration will depend on your security settings) before they are no longer valid. Either re-issue access or ask the user to click the Forgot Password link. Note: re-issuing access will send an access link to everyone who hasn't already received one OR anyone who has an access token has expired. So bear in mind that anyone who has not logged in with their first access token that has expired will get a new email sent at the same time (you can’t do this individually) see How do I issue user access for more details. If they haven't received an email, check the details as listed in No email received after forgot password request or issuing access. Check the Remuneration link they are using – if necessary, email them the link again, and perhaps ask them to close their browser, clear their cache and open a new session before trying to log in again.

It is good practice to review these each year at the start of your rem review to make sure they still align with your policies. If you access Rem via the Menu navigation from your ELMO then you will make security changes in the main site administration rather than in the rem module If you have SAML Single Sign On (SSO) - you will find this on the system administrator step. Change User ID / SSO Setup. If you do not have Single Sign On - the Security Settings tab is now combined with the step for Security Configuration If you can't find this menu, it's likely your site has been configured to have a different step name.

                  "chunkText": "What a test system can be used for: Testing the next steps of your rem process during your rem review without affecting the live system Troubleshooting issues (e.g. during your rem review) Training sessions or manuals Testing your whole rem process Don't use a test system for: Creating/amending letters as you can't copy these back to your live site The ability to copy your live system to your test system is a Sysadmin function. Copy Live to Test step System Administrators have the Copy Live to Test step and can request a copy. To request a copy Note: this function will create a copy of your live site at the point in time you make the request. All system data including employee details will be copied, meaning user passwords and emails can be changed to remove live data. 1. Choose and confirm a password to set for all user accounts in the new test site if you'd like to change the password. However we do encourage you to not change passwords in this process as it can mean you have a version of your live data with weak passwords that are consistent to every user. (Note: If you are using Single Sign On on your live site, you will need to set a global password in order to access the test site) 2. Choose an email to change all email addresses to for all user accounts in the new test site (e.g. your own) to overwrite any live addresses for any manual or auto notifications that you may send while testing. 3. Add in a reason for the copy (although this is not mandatory). 4. When you tick the Mask data copied to Test option, the following PII data will be masked in all locations in your test site: Username First Name Preferred Name Last Name Email Address Date of Birth Address lines 1 - 4 Start Date Title (Mr, Mrs, Miss, etc) 5.. Click save. A message will display saying you can't use the process because a request is in progress (yours). It can take up to 15 minutes for the process to complete, during which the screen will show the request as pending. When it's completed you'll receive a confirmation email, and you’ll be able to log into your test site with the password you set in step 1 above. Points to note: If you want to test issuing user access in your test site, you should overwrite/import data into your test site as the copy process affects how user accounts are dealt with. Remember to import dummy email addresses so you don't send any notifications to your live users. Anyone who needs to log into the test site should use the relevant username and the password that was reset in Step 1 above (unless you have elected to just use the existing passwords in live) . (Note: If you have done a masked copy, the username will be the employee ID, as this is what will be in the masked username field.) Any Forgot Password requests in the test site for any user accounts will be sent to the email address that was set in Step 2 above.  Comments:  Author Name: Fred Ho Section:",

This shows all requests for a new password and whether ‘Successful’ or ‘Failed’:a) If the request failed, the reason will be shown in the report. The most common reason is because an incorrect username was entered (see Step 3).b) If the request was successful, continue to 2. Check the user email address in the system using Create / Edit User or Build Reports:a) If their email address is incorrect, correct it through Create / Edit User and ask them to do another forgot password request.b) If the email address is correct, ask them to check their junk/spam email. Continue to step 3 if the email is not in their junk or spam. Provide them with their username and tell them to use the forgot password option again. Additional steps Steps 1 to 3 haven’t resolved the issue? Has the manager only got employees in a split that hasn't had access issued yet? They won't get an email until that happens. Contact your IT department to understand your company IT security requirements; for example, Pivot may need to be added to an IT whitelist.

                  "chunkText": "This article outlines the purpose of the Multi-factor Authentication feature and how to access your site when this is enabled. This article contains the following topics: What is Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)? MFA Configuration How to login when MFA is enabled FAQs What is Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)? Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security measure that requires two or more proofs of identity to grant you access. It helps protect against phishing, social engineering, and brute-force password attacks and prevents logins from attackers exploiting weak or stolen credentials. The first factor of authentication is your username and password, the additional factors of authentication are verification codes that can be sent to either your email address or mobile number. How will this function work if you already have SSO implemented? ELMO will automatically accept the authentication results from your integrated identity provider, and will not ask the users to go through the ELMO MFA process. We recommend using the MFA mechanism through your identity provider for a consistent user experience. Return to table of contents MFA Configuration Roles Applicable in MFA MFA is enabled by default for the following user groups: Company Admin - staff with admin access to change overall system settings HR Manager - HR Administrators, Generalist or other functions that can access employee information (If you have subscribed to our HR Core module) Payroll Admin - Employees who manage Payroll (If you have subscribed to the ELMO Payroll module) MFA can also be enabled for the following groups: Manager - Any employee who has at least one direct report Employee - General staff members within your organisation To make MFA require for Managers or Employees please raise a support ticket. Verification Code Delivery Verification codes can be sent to either the Email Address or Mobile Number recorded in the user's profile. This can be configured to one or both options for your organisation. When both options are selected, users will choose their preferred option during the verification process. ✔️ SMS notifications are recommended for employees using personal email addresses 📝 What to do if you want to use SMS notification services? SMS is only available to clients with an SMS notification module. Please contact your ELMO Account Manage if you wish to add SMS notifications as part of your ELMO service subscription. MFA Instruction Message The instruction message provided for MFA can be customised to suit your organisation. The default message is \"Please contact your company admin if you need any assistance with MFA\". Please raise a support ticket if you wish to modify this. Return to table of contents How to login when MFA is enabled First-time login after MFA is enabled Navigate to the login page. Enter your username and password and click Login (If both email and mobile methods are available) Choose your preferred verification method then click Continue. Confirm the email address or mobile number depending on the method selected and then click Continue. Confirm Mobile Number Confirm Email Address ⚠️ Not able to change your email address or mobile number? If the Administrator of your organisation has allowed users to update/edit email addresses or mobile numbers, users can manually update these details on this screen. If this option is not enabled, users will need to contact their Administrator to update their email address or mobile number before they can complete the MFA verification process. A verification code will be sent to the nominated email address or mobile number. Enter your 6-digit verification code received via email or mobile, and click Login. Once the code is verified, you’ll be logged in and directed to the Dashboard. Subsequent login Navigate to the login page. Enter your username and password, click Login. Enter your 6-digit verification code received via email or mobile, and click Login. Once the code is verified, you’ll be logged in and directed to the Dashboard. Return to table of contents FAQs How do I enable SMS for MFA? SMS for MFA is only available to clients with an SMS notification module. Please contact your ELMO Account Manager if you wish to add SMS to your ELMO service subscription. Why can't our users edit their own email address or mobile number during first-time verification? Users can only edit their email address or mobile number when the relevant settings are marked as editable. Please raise a support ticket to request permissions for these fields to be changed. Why has a user not received a verification code? All users need to be activated and notified to receive a verification code. (See How do I notify a user?) It is also recommended that you reach out internally to your IT team to review all filtering and security settings on your end to ensure these emails can be received by your email provider. How many times can users resend verification codes? A user will be locked out for 6 hours if they request a new code more than 3 times when attempting to log in. A user will also be locked out for 10 minutes if they enter the incorrect code 3 times. What should I do if a user is locked out? Users with Company Admin access can reset MFA on a users account to avoid the 6 hour wait: 1. As an Company Admin, navigate to Administration &gt; General &gt; Users. 2. Search for the user. 3. Select View Profile from the dropdown on the far right next to Edit. 4. Go to the Action dropdown underneath their profile photo, click Reset MFA. 5. Confirm your action and click OK. The verified icon right next to the email address will disappear and the user will be unlocked. Can the same email address or mobile number be used for more than 1 account? Yes, however we do recommend that each account in the system have a unique email and mobile number number as this can affect actions such as the forgot password requests. Are there any options available other than email or SMS? Currently only SMS and email are supported. What roles require MFA by default? \"Company Admins\" and users belonging to security groups of type \"HR Manager\" and \"Payroll Admin\". What additional users can I enable MFA for as a requirement? MFA can also be enforced for Employees and Managers. Please lodge a support ticket and our team can enable this for you. Will this apply to login into the payroll directly not via HR core? Logging directly into payroll will rely on your payroll’s existing authentication mechanism. Our company uses SSO to login, how will MFA work? ELMO will rely on your identity provider (IdP) used for SSO to authenticate your users. We strongly recommend enabling MFA within your IdP to secure your accounts. ELMO will not present an MFA challenge for users logging in using SSO and this will only be available for users signing in directly through your ELMO sites Login page with a username and password.

Click Open for recompletion at the bottom of the form. 2. Confirm by selecting Reopen the form. ❗ You cannot reverse this action. Once a form is re-opened it must be recompleted. 3.

Return to table of contents Create a new assignment of a form This setting assigns the form again, rather than overwriting the data in the existing form. Use this setting when a form must be re-completed, and you wish to keep a history of each completed form. You might consider using this for forms that capture certifications or other documentation that you need to retain records of. To create a new assignment of a form: 1. Click Create new assignment. ⚠️ Only the most recent created form will show the option to Create a new assignment. This recompletion method is not compatible with the Unique assignment feature.

Return to table of contents FAQ Section Can I change the recompletion method on an Existing forms You can change the recompletion method of a form. Navigate to the form settings and select the new recompletion method then click save. There is no need to republish the form when this feature is changed. Users that go to recomplete their form will see this change reflected. What is the difference between the “Unique assignment” feature and the “Disallow recompletion” method? The purpose of Unique assignment is to ensure that a form can only ever be assigned and completed once per user.The purpose of Disallow recompletion is to ensure that a completed form cannot be edited or overwritten, however it can still be assigned to, and completed by, the same user more than once. Example 1: If Unique assignment is DISABLED And Disallow recompletion is ENABLED Then after User A completes the form, they are unable to overwrite or edit that form’s data. If the form is re-assigned manually to User A, they can complete the new assignment of the form. Example 2: If Unique assignment is ENABLED And Disallow recompletion is ENABLED Then after User A completes the form, they are unable to overwrite or edit that form’s data. And the form cannot be manually re-assigned to User A again. Return to table of contents Comments:  Author Name: Michael Ho Section:",

The system administrator role can create and alter the lists in Table Maintenance. Note: You can stop the list values being created by an import - for more information see the How do you limit the values used in a drop down list? article. You can only remove an option from the drop down list if it isn't assigned to any employee. If you remove an option it will no longer appear on the Data Amend screen. If you include the option you have removed in a future import file then it will reappear in the drop down list. An example: You have imported a file of employees who have a Country value of Australia, New Zealand and India. You then add a new employee via Data Amend who is based in Mexico. The list of options for Country in the Data Amend screen will only offer Australia, New Zealand and India unless you go into Table Maintenance and add Mexico as an option to that drop down list (or import the employee record).

Employees can only access their own appraisals for creating discussion items. Peer Conversations (Non-Manager-Employee Relationship): Users can hold one-on-one meetings with peers, seniors, or other colleagues (e.g., coaches or other managers). In this case: Users can only access their own appraisals to create discussion items. Privacy in Conversations Conversations are private to the users involved: Only the participants in a conversation can access the discussions. Admins, even with impersonation privileges, cannot access these discussions. 📝 If an admin logs in as another user, they will not see the Conversations tab for the impersonated account. Only the actual user logged into their own account can view and access this tab. When notes from Conversations are added to appraisals, they become visible to users with access to the respective appraisal. Return to table of contents  Comments:  Author Name: Kayla Li Section:",

This feature is available for those with ELMO/REM Data Feed Table of contents: Overview Where to Delete Users Delete deactivated Users Why some cannot be deleted at first sight? Overview When an Employee is Deactivated in ELMO HR the employee details are kept in Rem Module. For some, an employee may still be eligible for a Rem/Bonus payout (separate to the final pay run) even after they've left. Currently when an Employee is deactivated in ELMO, System Admin will need to raise a ticket to Support to have users removed from REM Module. Where to delete users? Users are firstly deactivated from ELMO HR being the source of truth for employee details System Admin will see 'Deactivated Users' in Admin Dashboard after they click on Remuneration on the left-hand menu Delete deactivated users System Admin can now see the list of deactivated employees from ELMO HR (TMS) Deleting a user means removing any remuneration document (history &amp; current), employee details and letters in REM module They can either individually DELETE or DELETE ALL A warning message will appear before finalising Why some cannot be deleted at first sight? This means that they are recognised as REM Managers in the REM Module with direct reports System Admin needs to reassign their direct reports to someone else BEFORE deleting them The action to reassign happens in REM Module under Data Amend EXAMPLE If I want to delete Louis Litt who is also a REM Manager with 3 direct reports, I will need to reassign them to someone else This can be done using the drag and drop facility in the Organisation Chart, or This is done directly in Data Amend by changing Manager Name from Louis Litt to someone else. The user can then review the original Employee, Louis Litt in Data Amend and delete or via the new “Deactivated Users” step in their MyRem Admin page.  Comments:  Author Name: Johnny Wen Section:",

This article covers the following topics: How to Bulk or Manually Delete Appraisals? Appraisals Assigned by Active Assignment Rules How to Allow or Disallow Managers to Assign or Delete Appraisals? Understanding the Need to Delete a Performance Appraisal How to Bulk or Manually Delete Appraisals? ❗ Once an appraisal is deleted, it cannot be recovered or rolled back.

Click Confirm Return to table of contents Appraisals Assigned by Active Assignment Rules When you select appraisals that are assigned by an active assignment rule, please note the following: Appraisals tied to an active assignment rule will not be deleted during bulk deletion. These appraisals cannot be individually deleted until the conditions in the appraisal assignment rule no longer apply to the employee. ⚠️ If your selection contains appraisals assigned by an active assignment rule these will not be deleted. Refer to our article on how to delete appraisals assigned via assignment rules - FAQ: Appraisal Assignment Rules How to Allow or Disallow Managers to Assign or Delete Appraisals? As a company admin, you can control this setting at the company level. This configuration determines whether managers have the ability to assign or delete appraisals. For step-by-step guidance on how to update these settings, refer to this article: How do I allow/disallow managers to assign or delete appraisals Understanding the Need to Delete a Performance Appraisal Deleting a performance appraisal may be necessary to ensure data accuracy and organizational effectiveness. Here are some key reasons why you might want to delete a performance appraisal: Error Correction: If inaccuracies or errors exist in the performance appraisal, deleting it allows for a clean slate to make necessary corrections. Employee Position Change: In cases where an employee changes their position mid-way in the appraisal period, you can delete their appraisal to assign a new appraisal with the relevant data. Confidentiality Concerns: If confidential information is inadvertently included in an appraisal, deleting it helps maintain data privacy and compliance. Template Adjustments: If an appraisal template change cannot be synced, you can delete redundant appraisals to reassign a new appraisal with the new template changes.

Select the users you'd like to assign the Workflow to &gt; click the Assign to selected users button at the bottom of the page 4. A Confirm Workflow Assignment box that appears at the top of the page and Click the Confirm button to assign the workflow Return to table of contents Ways to prevent assigning a workflow to the same user twice When assigning workflows in bulk, it can be easy to create duplicate assignments by accident. Here are some ways to identify users who already have the workflow assigned and prevent creating duplicates: 1. Users that already have the workflow assigned are displayed in grey within the user list. For example the user Harry Potter appears in grey below 2. Use the Hide users with existing assignments filter to remove them from the list. In the example below, Harry potter no longer appears: 3. The Confirm Workflow Assignment box will inform you when you're about to create a duplicate assignment Return to table of contents Deleting Workflow assignment 1. Navigate to Administration &gt; Onboarding &gt; Onboarding workflows 2. Find the respective onboarding workflow, click the Drop down icon &gt; Workflow Assignments 3. Find the respective workflow assignment &gt; Delete 📝 If there are duplicate assignments, click onto View Activity to view the activities list to ensure the desired workflow is to be Deleted. ❗ The delete function cannot be undone Assign the workflow via the user profile As a Company Administrator, you are able to manually assign a workflow to general or onboarding users via their user profile. 1. Navigate to Administration &gt; General &gt; Users 2. Open the relevant user profile 3. Open the Actions menu, and select Assign Workflow 4. Select the desired workflow from the dropdown list and click Assign Return to table of contents Assign the workflow via the My Team page The user's Manager or Second Level Manager is also able to assign a workflow via the My Team tab. 1. Select the relevant user on the Team Members tab &gt; Open the Actions menu and select Assign Workflow 2. Select the desired workflow from the dropdown list and click Assign Return to table of contents Assign the workflow when you convert a candidate to a user Another option is to assign the workflow at the same time you convert your candidate to an onboarding or general user. This method is only available to the Company Administrator, Manager or Second-Level Manager of the candidate. When a candidate has accepted an offer, then the candidate can be converted to a General/Onboarding User by using the Create User Account or Create Onboarding Account options available in the Actions dropdown menu against the candidate in the requisition. To assign the workflow: 1. Click on Recruitment &gt; Requisitions 2. Locate the requisition the candidate has accepted the offer for 3. Click on the Candidates &gt; Offer tab and select the Actions button next to the candidate 4. Click on either the Create User Account to convert the candidate to a general user or Create Onboarding Account to convert the candidate to an onboarding user ⚠️ Important Note: If you select the \"Create User Account\" option to convert the candidate to a General User, only the Company Admin user and the candidate's manager and second level manager (assigned in the requisition) will have access to assign a workflow this way. If you select the \"Create Onboarding Account\" option to convert the candidate to an Onboarding user, the same will apply, however any user with the Onboarding Administrator Page Permissions security profile will also have access to perform to assign a workflow this way. 5. A popup will appear on the page. Select a workflow in the drop down menu under Select Workflow to assign the workflow and click Assign 6. The Add New User page will be displayed. You can edit/enter the necessary details for the user before clicking on the Save button. 7. A success message User Details have been updated! will be displayed. 8. You can verify the assignment of the workflow by viewing the User Profile and looking under the Workflow section in the Activity tab of the User Profile. If you are not able to see the onboarding workflow to select in the drop down menu, please check the Availability field against the onboarding workflow settings to ensure the option None has not been chosen. If you have a group of administrators that should only have access to certain workflows, then it's recommend you use the Selected Users or Static Group for the Availability field. ⚠️ Important Note: You can skip assigning an onboarding workflow while converting candidates to General/Onboarding Users(create User/Onboarding account for candidates) by clicking the Skip button in the Assign Workflow popup window.

There are two methods of logging into the system: Standard login where a user navigates to the login screen of your ELMO site and inputs a username and password. SSO (single sign on) where a user signs in to your identity provider and then navigates to the ELMO site where they will be granted access. This article covers the following topics: Standard Login errors Forgot password notifications Single Sign on (SSO) Login errors Standard Login errors A common error that occurs when users attempt a Standard login is the username or password is incorrect or invalid credentials. ⚠️ These kind of errors only occur when the credentials that the user has provided are not correct preventing the user from logging in to the system. When these errors occur you can use any of the following troubleshooting steps to help your end users gain access to the system. Check the User is Notified 1. Navigate to Administration &gt; General &gt; Users. 2. Search for the User by name. 3. If the user has not been notified please do so. This will generate a notification with a link that will allow the user to login and set a password for the first time. For steps on how to do this please review the article here.

If you use [EXPIRY] in the issue password email, your users will be able to see the expiry period for the token in the email. The user requested a new password - when a new link/token is issued, it will expire the previous token. The user has already logged in successfully using the link/token - once a token is used it expires - the user should then log in with the normal URL instead.

Problem to Solve: Rem review is a collaborative process that involves multiple levels of managers to recommend, calibrate, finalise and communicate outcome to individual employees. Current setup - whilst allowing managers to preview, print or email outcome remuneration or bonus letters - different levels of managers share the same permissions. This often leads to confusion over who is supposed to do what - whether Approval Managers need to check the payout figures are accurate or Rem Managers to email letters directly to individuals. Current Permissions is only around email capability and all Managers are grouped together Then we have a separate set of ticks for “when” a letter is available to a user group and again all Managers are grouped together Reminder: make sure your manager roles are active - this can be done by raising a support ticket for ELMO to enable for you. What’s New Display of Letter Permission in “Set Up Letters” You’ll now see the permission panel for each letter - an overview of which role has what access in relation to the letter You can customise permission letter-to-letter System Admin to break down letter responsibility to each role As a System Admin, when clicking the ‘magnifying glass’ you’re able to tick/untick permissions This feature will break letter functions down to each role such as Approval Manager, Rem Manager, Line Managers, etc - all with System Admin’s control. If managers are not granted with access, they WILL NOT see the option to 'Email' or 'Print' Reminder: Letter Permission is only available to System Admin in 'Set Up Letters'  Comments:  Author Name: Johnny Wen Section:",

A change in the retrain period for a course after a user has already completed the course. Enrolled users will not have the course retrain triggered, and as a result they will be listed on the retrain discrepancies page. Reviewing and Managing retrain discrepancies To review and manage any retrain discrepancies: 1. Go to Administration &gt; Learning &gt; Retrain Discrepancies 2. A new page appears displaying a list of the courses and users that need to recomplete a course but the recompletion required status has not been triggered. From this page an administrator has two options. They can: Fix Retrain - The status of the course will change to Recompletion Required and the user is now required to recomplete the course. Disable Retrain - This disables the retrain requirement for this enrolment, and the user will no longer be required to recomplete the course. To manage a retrain discrepancy for a single user, click on Fix Retrain next to the learner or use the dropdown to select Disable Retrain. 3. Retrain discrepancies can also be fixed in batches. The most number of discrepancies that can be fixed at a time is 10 as this is the number of records displayed per page. To select a batch of retrain discrepancies click on the header checkbox. Then click on the dropdown next to Actions &gt; Fix Retrain. Return to table of contents  Comments:  Author Name: Permanently deleted user Section:",

Method 2: Modifying Existing User Data Navigate to Administration &gt; General &gt; Users Export the current user list from the system. Open the exported file and make the necessary modifications to the fields that require updating e.g. manager, position, department, etc. Save changes and import the file. ⚠️ ⚠️ The existing user field values will be overwritten by the values in the file.

Solution You can export data from your Rem system by using the Build Reports step, by selecting the fields you require. Note, there is no 'select all' option, you have to select each field separately. Bear in mind that if extracting all data this may cause the report to run very slowly (or even time out depending on how many fields you have) - so you may need to think about breaking the data into sections and running separately. Depending on what data you need (e.g. is it a certain subset of fields or all fields) you may want to look at just exporting data for a certain purpose, or look to see if other reports contained within Standard Reports such as the Employee Detail report may give you enough information (depending on the use requirement).

Solution Select the fields you'd like to export in the field selection box and click on Update Sort List. This moves the fields to the grid on the right. Click Apply under the grid to refresh the reports screen with the selected data. You can then filter on any of the headings in the report screen by entering the criteria you want to filter on and then clicking on the filter icon. If the field is a text field, the options to select for the filter will be related to text. If the field is not a text field, the options to select for the filter will be related to the type of field. For example, a % field will need numerical filters. Note: A % field needs a decimal entered You can apply filters to more than one heading in the same export. Note: Filtered reports can only be exported to Excel - CSV exports will ignore filters and export only raw data (the whole list). You can save the filters for use again, for example if it's an export you need to run regularly. Enter a name for the report in the blank field Click on Save a new report The next time you return to this screen the report will be available in the dropdown in Select a saved report  Comments:  Author Name: Fred Ho Section: Reports & exports",

For a range value these need to be: The first column heading is “&gt;= [data]” The second column heading is “&lt; [data] - Maximum Value” With that in mind the process to import Mapped table data with a range is the same as above: Export the data from the ‘Mapped table’ screen (this will have the correct column headings) Amend the data Import the data using the ‘Data Import’ screen. Alternative 1: Child/Parent Feature For simple mapped tables (i.e. where there is only one input to get the mapped result), an alternative set-up (Child/Parent) can replace the mapped table and allow system administrators to update the values whenever they wish. An example would be where you currently have mapped tables to provide a minimum and maximum recommended % increase, depending on an individual's performance rating, with these figures being shown on the rem screen. We would delete the table and set the min % (or max %) field as a 'child' of the Performance Rating field (the 'parent'). Then in Table Maintenance step, the administrator selects Performance Rating and they would see the list of ratings, with two additional columns for the Min % Increase and Max % Increase respectively and they can change the values in these columns for each rating and save. Child values can also be imported (via a special import type) to save time. The parent field must be a look-up type field in order for this set-up to be an option. See this article for further information on using this feature: Parent and child lookups (Table Maintenance) Note: There is an initial cost to delete your table(s) and set up the parent/child relationship. Contact us to discuss whether this option will work for you.  Comments:  Author Name: Fred Ho Section:",

This will open the Report in a new window.    Depending on the report that you have chosen to run you may be asked to provide some additional information, like which course, user, performance appraisal, or form you want to run a report on.    Select the relevant report criteria and if applicable click Generate Report. Below is an example of a Form Status Report, and a Learner Report.    There are some key fields to be aware of:    Field Description    The Export button allows you to export your data from your TMS. The available options may vary slightly between reports however you are generally able to export data to PDF, or to CSV. PDF: Will be a PDF file of what you see on screen CSV: Will be a CSV file of the data – this is recommended if you need to do any data analysis offline. Note: The PDF will be generated automatically, and you will receive an on screen message with a prompt to download the PDF. CSV files can take a little bit of time to generate. Once the CSV report is ready, you will receive an email with a link to access the report. The link expires after 24 hours.    Create Filter will allow you to apply filters to your report so that you can run reports based on specific criteria. Standard Fields include: Employee Name Manager Name Position Department Location You will also see any custom profile fields that your System Administrator requested. When creating a filter, you are not limited to one field. For example, you could filter for Position: Finance Manager and Location: Melbourne.   You also have a checkbox to Save this filter which will allow you to use the filter in other reports.    The View button appears in some reports and allows you to view the specific details for that employee. For example, if you click View in a Form Status Report you will be able to view that specific employees form.",

This article covers the following topics: What Is the Position History Importer When Should I Use the Position History Importer How To Import Historical Position Records Frequently Asked Question (FAQs) What Is the Position History Importer The Position History Importer is a tool designed to help HR Managers efficiently manage and update employee position history in bulk. This tool enhances the ability to maintain precise and organised position records, while also allowing for easy updates and future reference in the change history. 📝 The importer only affects historical position data. It does not update the employee's current active position. Using this importer, you can: Override Existing Historical Position Records: Correct or update past position data to reflect accurate employment position history. Protect Active Primary Positions: The employee’s current primary position remains unchanged by the import. Track Changes Clearly: Each imported record creates a separate entry in the employee’s User Change History tab, allowing for clear tracking of updates and changes over time. *Identify Primary Positions: Use the import file to define which positions were primary throughout the employee’s employment history, ensuring differentiation between primary and additional roles. *Primary Positions are only applicable if the concurrent positions feature is enabled. See more on concurrent positions here: Concurrent Positions in HR Core Return to table of contents When Should I Use the Position History Importer Use the Position History Importer when you need to: Add or correct historical position records across multiple users. Apply updates after initial onboarding, once primary positions have been assigned. Organise employee career progression and history in a clear, sequential format. Return to table of contents How To Import Historical Position Records ❗ Importing will replace all existing data in the employee's position history, including position, manager, location, and department details. To retain a record of current data, use Export CSV on the Change History page before importing. 1. Navigate to Administration &gt; HR Core &gt; Import Profile. 2. Search and select Position History. 3. Click Download the CSV import template to save a CSV template copy on your computer. 4. Review the legend on the import page. Each field includes guidance and examples for correct formatting. 📝 Ensure you use the correct User Identifier for your system, as specified in the legend. 5. Populate the template with the historical position data. 6. Upload the file or drag the file to the highlighted box. 7. Click Import Valid Rows 8. A success message will confirm if the valid rows have been imported successfully. 9. Once complete, the employee’s Position History (under the Employment History tab) will reflect the changes, and the User Change History will show the import activity for tracking purposes. ⚠️ The importer only affects historical position data. It does not update the employee's current active position. Return to table of contents Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Why did my import fail? The import may fail due to incorrect data formatting or missing required fields in the CSV template. Check the data against the template legend to ensure all fields are correctly filled. If entering or pasting data, ensure it’s properly formatted. Download and populate the template to verify your data matches the required structure. Why does the imported data not appear in the employee's Position History? The import may not have been successful. Please check for any error messages during the import process, and verify that valid rows were successfully imported. I accidentally imported the wrong data. How do I undo the import? Imports cannot be undone. To correct the data, head to the employee's Change History tab and delete the incorrect records. You can then perform the import again to upload the correct data. Can I use the Position History Importer to update an employee's active position? No, the Position History Importer only affects historical position data, not the employee's current active position. To update an employee's current position, edit their profile and make the relevant changes under their Profile tab. What happens if I import historical position data without exporting the current data first? If you don't export the current data first, the import will overwrite existing historical data, and you may lose the current position history. It's recommended to back up data via the Change History tab &gt; Export CSV option before proceeding. Do I need to format the CSV file in a specific way? Yes, ensure that you follow the format guidelines provided in the import template legend. Incorrect formatting may lead to import errors. Can I track changes made by the Position History Importer? Yes, each imported record creates an entry in the employee’s User Change History tab, allowing you to track all updates and changes made during the import process. The date is being flipped around and uploaded incorrectly. What should I do? This may happen due to Excel settings modifying the date format. Please check your Excel settings to ensure the date is not being altered. After saving your file, re-open it to confirm the date fields are saved correctly. If the issue persists, try uploading the file from a different device. Return to table of contents Comments:  Author Name: Katherine Gotsopoulos Section:",

                  "chunkText": "We know it may seem a long way off until next year, but at the end of your remuneration review there are some things that you should do in preparation for the next review to make it as straightforward as possible. Document your processes and rules Export data and letters Run standard reports Check Client Identity Provider Certificate Expiry Date Remove employee data or lock system access Keep system administrator records up to date Note pain points/areas for improvement What worked well Set reminders Use our training materials Document your processes and rules This is so you can remind yourself of the process next year and be able to clearly see any changes that might be needed. It’s also useful for handover information if you might not be the person doing the task next year. Export data and letters As the data is overwritten each year, export any data out of your system that you might want to keep using the Build Reports step. A CSV file will give you the raw figures (no rounding) where Excel will round values. Export and file letters if you want to keep copies. Run Standard Reports Run and save any standard reports as required. Check the Client Identity Provider Certificate expiry date If you have Single Sign On (SSO), check the expiry date of your Client Identity Provider Certificate. This can be found under the SSO Setup step on the Single Sign On tab. Make a note of the date; you should update the certificate before this expires (your SSO access won't work if the certificate has expired). Remove employee data or lock system access You're responsible for your data that's held in your remuneration system, so consider if you want to remove employee and review data from your rem system once you've finished your review. If you don't want to remove it, you may want to lock access for users - if you want to do this, contact Pivot for more information. Don't forget to leave any system administrator records if you'll need access. Keep system administrator records up to date If any of your system administrators leave throughout the year, remove their access from your rem system and also let us know so we can keep our Support Centre records up to date. Likewise, if you have any new system administrators please let us know and we can send them links to our training materials. Note pain points/areas for improvement What gave you a headache this year and why? Note it down and what you think could be done to avoid it next year. Did you have enough time to test? Was your data of a good quality? Did you understand the system enough or did you need more training? Note down anything you’d like to discuss with Pivot either now or in good time before next year’s review. What worked well Note down what worked well and why, and how this can be repeated next year. Take action to put any lessons learnt into practice, or to document any best practice ready for next year. Set reminders Set yourself a reminder at least 3 months before your review is due to start to start thinking about any changes you want. Remember Pivot need a minimum of one month to assess, quote and schedule any reconfiguration for you; any requests after this time can’t be guaranteed for completion. Use our training materials You’ll want to review our training materials and guidance articles well in advance of a rem review to refresh yourself on how to use the system, so make a list of the videos and documents that you’ll need to go through and set some time aside to do this.

You, the customer, are responsible for your data and the maintenance of it when held in systems. We, Pivot, are responsible for the security of the systems that hold this data. What is Personal Information? “Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person Different pieces of information, which collected together can lead to the identification of a particular person, also constitute personal data” Working with us You should never send us files containing personal information, such as import files. In most cases, we can get this information through your system with the appropriate security already in place. If we do ask you to send us any data files, you should send these in Excel format that is password protected, and phone us with the password. You should never send us any personal information in the body text of the email. If you send us any screenshots, you should blank or blur out any personal information before sending. Best practice Consider the use of SSO (Single Sign-On) rather than a direct login Make sure your password policy is set up to a secure standard (contact us for more information) Always use secure passwords, including on test sites (and make sure those passwords are different to those for live sites) Block access to your Pivot system from outside your corporate network (contact us for more information) Consider what personal data is in a test site outside the duration of testing Do not allow users to use personal email such as Hotmail or Yahoo to login to Pivot Think about how you get data in and out of the system, and what processes you have in place to protect your data -never email import or export files that contain personally identifiable information without password protection and encryption in place Be mindful of where your data is stored, and think about deleting import/export files from workstations if you no longer need them, or make sure there is adequate restricted security for wherever they are held so that the data is only available to people who need to use it Be mindful of what data you are giving people access to when assigning user roles within your systems Overwrite import your live and test Rem site at the end of your rem review to remove personal data (taking what information you may need first)  Comments:  Author Name: Fred Ho Section:",

Forgot Password requests return a single use access token link by email to the user including a warning that the token will expire in [your configured value] and if they did not request this email to notify their system administrator. Their existing password will continue to work until they action the password reset. If the time period runs out before they click the link they will have to make another request.

                  "chunkText": "Welcome to our FAQ section! Here, you’ll find quick answers to the most common questions about syncing appraisal, phase, and section settings while addressing common issues and limitations. If you don’t see your question listed, feel free to contact us directly. 📝 To sync an appraisal, please follow the steps outlined here - Synchronise an Appraisal This article covers the following topics: Appraisal, Phase, or Section Settings How to sync appraisal, phase, or section settings? How to sync section changes? How to sync phase date changes? Notifications Why were there multiple phase notifications sent out? Limitations of Sync Why have the changes not synced to assigned appraisals? Appraisal, Phase, or Section Settings How to sync appraisal, phase, or section settings? Sync your appraisal and select the 'Template settings' option. This option will sync data under the Appraisal Settings, Phase Settings, or Section Settings sections to all related appraisals. 1. Appraisal Settings 2. Appraisal Phases 3. Appraisal Sections How to sync section changes? Sync your appraisal and select the 'Section' option. This option will sync the following changes: 1. Adding a New Section: When an admin adds new sections to a template and synchronises, the system will automatically add the new sections and the section items into the appraisals related to the template. 2. Removing a Section: When admins remove a section in an appraisal template and then synchronise, the system will remove the entire section data, including: Section items Notes and Attachments in the sections/section item ❗ Deleted sections or items cannot be restored after the sync. 3. Updating a Section: The system syncs the Title, Weight, and Description of sections to all related appraisals. For checkpoint sections, admins can adjust the start and end dates of each checkpoint and sync them to appraisals. Existing section items, notes, and attachments in the appraisals remain untouched to preserve any modifications made by the employee and manager. 4. Re-ordering Sections: When managing performance appraisals, re-ordering sections is a seamless task that allows for optimized organization and presentation of appraisal data. Re-ordered sections can be synchronised. 5. Checkpoint Dates: Checkpoint dates can be synced, and the system automatically updates notification schedules related to the checkpoint accordingly. How to sync phase date changes? Sync your appraisal and select the 'Phase dates' option. This option will sync changes that are made to the phase dates under the Appraisal Phases tab, such as date changes to the planning, action, self or manager scoring (review) phases, approval phases, 360 review, and complete phases. ⚠️ For the sync feature to work effectively, the title, order, and number of phases match. Any discrepancies in these aspects will prevent the system from syncing any changes in phase dates. Syncing phase dates not only updates them but also resends notifications for the relevant phases. This includes updates to scheduled notifications related to phases. 360 Review Due Date 360 Review Task Due Action Phase Due Date Appraisal Approval Task Due Date Manager Scoring Phase Due Date Planning Phase Due Date Self Scoring Phase Due Date Return to table of contents Notifications Why were there multiple phase notifications sent out? Multiple phase notifications may be sent out if you have made changes or made updates to the phase dates. When you sync phase dates or all settings, the system automatically adjusts and reschedules notifications associated with the updated phase dates, such as: Action Phase Due Date Manager Scoring Phase Due Date Planning Phase Due Date Self Scoring Phase Due Date 360 Review Due Date 360 Review Task Due Return to table of contents Limitations of Sync Why have the changes not synced to assigned appraisals? The sync will not apply to the following: Completed Appraisals: Once appraisals are finalised, they cannot be synced. Company admins will need to roll back the appraisal before syncing to apply the changes. Exclude Appraisal Phase Data, Except Phase Dates: While synchronising data, it's crucial to omit any appraisal phase data except phase dates for streamlined information management. Changes at a Section Item Level: Any adjustments made at a section item level, such as editing goals or modifying section items within existing appraisals, are not synced for precise appraisal tracking. Data Related to 360 Reviews: Data linked with 360-degree reviews, including the review phase, specific sections, and questions, are not synchronised to ensure focused evaluation processes. Appraisal with Ratings Recorded: Whenever an appraisal contains recorded ratings, it will not be synced if at least one rating is present. Return to table of contents Still have questions?

Any notifications can be edited to become a scheduled notification. This can be done by setting the Send Notification to ‘Before or After trigger occurs’. 1. Choose one of the notifications and click edit.2. Find the Send notification header and set it to either ‘Before trigger occurs’ or ‘After trigger occurs’. ELMO's notification system offers a dual approach to communication delivery: Instant Triggers: Notifications can be instantly generated based on specific user actions within the application. Scheduled Delivery: Despite being triggered immediately, the actual dispatch of notifications adheres to the predefined Notification Schedule settings. Please click here to find the specific notification you want to check. Return to table of contents How to enable Notification Schedule? Any users with Company Admin access will be able to configure the settings on behalf of the company. 1. Navigate to Administration &gt; General &gt; Notifications 2. Under the Settings tab, you will see the Notification Schedule toggle. 3. Once enabled, you can then Set Notification Time. ⚠️ Our system requires at least 4 hours to process all scheduled notifications due to the large volume.

                  "chunkText": "Scenario A user is having issues accessing the Remuneration system, e.g. has tried logging in but can’t, or has locked themselves out. Possible Reasons They have forgotten their password They entered the wrong username They entered the wrong password They have tried to log in too many times They’ve asked for too many Forgot Password requests They are clicking on an expired access token link They haven't received an email They are using the wrong Remuneration system link Their browser has timed out or cached to a login page that is no longer valid You've not issued user passwords to allow users to access Steps Check the flowchart and text below to work your way through the troubleshooting process. Don't forget, ELMO Support can’t reset individual passwords or access any user details. Make sure you have issued user access and you’re familiar with your system security settings. If the user has forgotten their password, they should enter their username and click on the Forgot password link. Check the Login Attempt History and Forgotten Password reports in the Standard Reports step to view user activity against your system security settings. Login Attempt History - This report shows all login attempts and whether they are successful or failed - you’re looking for a failure reason for the user who has contacted you. Most often the reason for failure will be either entering the wrong password (ask them to make a Forgot Password request and reset their password) or entering the wrong username (advise the user of their correct username using the Data Amend screen). Forgot Password – This report shows all forgot password requests – you can match these against your security settings to see if the user has exceeded the maximum attempts in the time period and locked their account. Note: No forgotten password emails will be sent once a user gets to this limit. Have they locked themselves out? If the user has entered the wrong log in information multiple times they may be locked out. Advise them to wait the lockout time period before attempting to log in again. Has the access token they’re clicking on expired? Tokens only last for a limited time period (the actual duration will depend on your security settings) before they are no longer valid. Either re-issue access or ask the user to click the Forgot Password link. Note: re-issuing access will send an access link to everyone who hasn't already received one OR anyone who has an access token has expired. So bear in mind that anyone who has not logged in with their first access token that has expired will get a new email sent at the same time (you can’t do this individually) see How do I issue user access for more details. If they haven't received an email, check the details as listed in No email received after forgot password request or issuing access. Check the Remuneration link they are using – if necessary, email them the link again, and perhaps ask them to close their browser, clear their cache and open a new session before trying to log in again.

                  "chunkText": "The Security Settings tab is where you set your password settings according to your own internal company security protocols. It is good practice to review these each year at the start of your rem review to make sure they still align with your policies. If you access Rem via the Menu navigation from your ELMO then you will make security changes in the main site administration rather than in the rem module If you have SAML Single Sign On (SSO) - you will find this on the system administrator step. Change User ID / SSO Setup. If you do not have Single Sign On - the Security Settings tab is now combined with the step for Security Configuration If you can't find this menu, it's likely your site has been configured to have a different step name. Minimum standards and recommendations: Forgot Password Request Settings System minimum/recommended Min Password Length 8 Password must change after ‘x’ days Options: min 0 - max 100 days or, ‘no limit’. 90 Min number of upper case characters 1 Min number of alpha characters 1 Min number of numeric characters 1 Min password special characters Note: See below for special character classification Max consecutive login retries This is the specified number of consecutive invalid login attempts allowed, after which a user is restricted from further login attempts. This can be set for a certain time period (see below). This is to prevent a hacker from guessing your password by entering random characters continuously. 5 Max number of consecutive characters e.g. deeedman has 3 consecutive characters 2 Consecutive login retry interval minutes Interval options: min 15 min – max 24 hrs with 15 mins intervals. Specifies the time interval during which the unsuccessful login attempts must occur before the login account is disabled. e.g. If the login retry interval is set to 15 mins and the ‘maximum consecutive login retries’ is set to 4, the account is disabled if there are 4 unsuccessful login attempts within 15 minutes. 15 minutes Max consecutive password re-use e.g. password1, password2, password3 1 Min number of different passwords before re-use e.g. A user may re – use an earlier password only after 10 subsequent passwords. 3 Login failure lockout interval minutes Interval options: min 15 min – max 24 hrs with 15 mins intervals. Specifies the time-out that the user must wait to type their user name or password after a ‘login failure lockout’ has been activated. e.g. If the lockout interval is set to 15 mins a user must wait 15 minutes to login. 15 minutes Can password contain user name?

                  "chunkText": "Within this article, Performance administrators can understand how to create and link a rating system to fit their specific appraisal requirements. The rating system is a visual scale for users to rate themselves against the appraisal sections. This rating system can be applied to sections such as goals, development objectives, competencies, and summary. This article covers the following topics: How to Create a Rating System? How to Add a Rating System to a Section within an Appraisal? Changing Rating Systems in an Appraisal with Assignments Employee Visibility of Manager Rating Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) How to Create a Rating System? To create a new rating system: 1. Navigate to Administration &gt; Performance &gt; Rating Systems 2. Click Add New Rating System 3. Enter the rating system, including: Title: Enter the name of your rating system Description: Provide a brief description of the rating system. Style: Select how the rating scale will be displayed to users. Button: Allows a selection from a row of options. Hovering over the rating allows the display of the rating description. Drop Down: Allows a single selection from a drop-down menu. Slider: Allows a rating by adjusting a slider from left to right. Upon selecting a rating position on the slider, the rating description will be hover above. Star: Allows a rating based on the number of selected stars. 3. After selecting a style, add rating items to the system by clicking on the 'Add New Rating Item' button. For each item, enter: Title: Name of the rating item. 📝 A 'Rating Item' is the visible name and assigned value of the rating for users and reporting purposes. When users are rating, the system will always display the text names for the scores. In reporting it’s the numerical value that is displayed. Value: Numerical value of the rating item. ⚠️ Each 'Rating Item' value must be unique. Description: Brief description of the rating item, visible when a user hovers over certain rating style items. 4. Repeat step 4 for each rating item you would like to add. 📝 The Rating System can contain multiple Rating Items, depending on the desired scale (e.g., 6-point, 5-point, 3-point Rating Scale). 5. Once all the details have been filled in, click Save to create the new rating system. Return to table of contents How to Add a Rating System to a Section within an Appraisal? Rating systems can be added to various sections including Goals, Development Objectives, Competencies, Checkpoints, and Summary sections. 1. Navigate to Administration &gt; Performance &gt; Appraisal Setup 2. Click Appraisal Settings 3. Select the Appraisal Sections tab 4. Click on the Edit icon for the relevant section 5. Click Appraisal Section Settings 6. Under Section General Setting &gt; Tick 'Ratings is active' &gt; Rating System will appear below 7. Select the appropriate Rating System &gt; Save Return to table of contents Changing Rating Systems in an Appraisal with Assignments Rating systems cannot be updated or changed in an appraisal template if there are employees who are already assigned to the appraisal. The Rating System will be greyed out and a message will be displayed below. To change the rating system for an appraisal, you will need to delete/unassign all users from the appraisal. Please see the bulk delete appraisal article for more information. Return to table of contents Employee Visibility of Manager Rating Admins can allow employees to view manager scores (ratings) within the appraisal and have the option to configure when manager ratings are visible; after the Manager Scoring phase is finalised, or after the appraisal is finalised. To configure the manager rating display: 1. Navigate to Administration &gt; Performance &gt; Appraisal Setup 2. Click Appraisal Settings 3. Select the Appraisal Settings tab 4. Under Appraisal Settings &gt; Tick 'Employee can see manager score' to allow the employee to see manager ratings.Once this setting is enabled, the option to configure 'Overall Manager Rating Display' will become available with the following options: Manager Scoring Phase Finalised: The manager rating will be displayed after the Manager Scoring phase is completed. After Appraisal is Finalised: The manager rating will be displayed once the appraisal reaches the Complete phase. 5. Click Save to apply your changes. ✔️ Please ensure you sync the changes to apply the settings to existing appraisals. ⚠️ Checkpoints are not reliant on phases so the overall manager rating display setting will not apply to checkpoints. Checkpoint ratings will be visible immediately after the manager approves the checkpoint. See more on appraisal checkpoints here. Return to table of contents Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Can rating systems be uploaded or updated in bulk? Rating systems currently cannot be bulk uploaded or updated. Each rating system and rating item will need to be updated individually. Can ratings be added to Question sections? No, ratings cannot be added or enabled for Question sections. Ratings can only be enabled for Goal, Development Objective, Competency, Checkpoint, or Summary sections. Can the employee and manager provide ratings at the same time? No, ratings can only be submitted by either the employee during the Self Scoring phase or the manager during the Manager Scoring phase. Phases cannot occur at the same time and occur sequentially (one after the other) so employee and manager ratings must be provided in separate phases during the appraisal. Employees and managers cannot see the option to provide ratings, why are they unable to provide ratings? Ratings can only be provided by the employee during the Self Scoring phase, and by the manager during the Manager Scoring phase. Please ensure the appraisal has progressed to these phases to allow ratings to be provided. Admins can check which phase the appraisal is currently sitting in: View the employee's appraisal &gt; Click on the Diagnostics tool Under Compare Configurations &gt; Click the Phases tab &gt; Click the drop-downs to each phase until you can see the Status 'In Progress'. The 'In Progress' status indicates that the appraisal is currently sitting in this phase. Return to table of contents  Comments:  Author Name: Henrietta Guo Section:",

Steps There is a time period that a user must wait before they can try logging in again; this will depend on your security set up as this is specific to each client, which generally reflects your IT security requirements. If you'd like to check what these are you can find them in the Security Settings tab in your Security Configuration step. As a system administrator you should advise them to wait the required length of time before trying again. You could also advise them to request a forgotten password if they are entering the wrong password details (you can check this on the Login Attempts History report).

                  "chunkText": "When testing, you should follow your Remuneration Review Process from the very start to the end, making sure you test every part of system functionality in each role. This is a chance to familiarise yourself with how the system works for each role, along with mapping out how your review process will flow within the system. You should also test a variety of scenarios that may occur during your process. Refer Help Centre article Testing your Remuneration System and Processes for more information. Your Project Lead will send you testing guidelines relevant to your configuration. Note: This isn't an exhaustive list, and you should create and add your own scenarios and tests. Use a representative sample of your data that includes things such as: Part-time/full-time/casual Different parts of the business Several approval layers Different employees with all the benefits Additional data on top of mandatory to test custom calculations, etc. Using your own data helps with understanding the process, how to look for any anomalies, and how to troubleshoot. Please refer to the Pivot Remuneration training videos, help text within your system and the How to test calculations article. If you have a site with one or more review splits, you'll need to review each step/process/feature for each split. Hints and Tips Making Remuneration System Changes When making Remuneration system changes, it is highly recommended to follow the below process: Take a screenshot and notes of the current settings in place BEFORE changes are made Make the needed system changes Test the system changes to ensure they provide the desired outcome In the event your changes don't give you the desired outcome, then you can revert the system back to the prior settings based on the notes and screenshots taken. Complete a copy live to test and make the required changes in your test environment. Once testing has been completed and you are getting the required outcomes replicate these changes in your live environment. Note: If logging a ticket to the Support Team for assistance, please ensure you provide all information including the changes made and the desired outcome. Comments:  Author Name: Fred Ho Section:",

This section enables managers, approvers, and employees to provide commentary throughout each phase and allows ratings to be entered during the self-scoring and manager scoring phases during the performance cycle. 📝 For more information on the summary section, see our article FAQ: Summary Section. This article covers the following topics: How do I add a summary section? Ratings and Comments Display Settings How do I add a summary section? 1. Go to Administration &gt; Performance and click Appraisal Setup. 2. Along the template title click the dropdown beside the Appraisal Settings button and select Appraisal Sections. 3. Click the Add New Section button. This opens up a new drop-down allowing you to fill in the following information: Module: The type of section that you want to add (in this example it is a Summary). Title: This is the title that is displayed to all users. Description: This should be a description of the Summary section that the user sees. Section Visibility: An administrator can determine if the section is visible to the employees and managers. Overall Rating Type: This allows administrators to select which overall rating type to be used. Please see the below overall rating type definition. Auto-calculate: Calculates the average of the ratings from all other sections, and displays the rating (and converts if this rating system is different from the other sections). You can have the value appear as 2 decimal places for additional granularity. Auto-Select: Provides the auto-calculated rating, but this can be overridden. Manual Rating: Allows a manual rating to be selected. The rating can be added during the Scoring Phases. No Final Rating: No rating, just commentary Rating System: If a rating is enabled this allows the system administrators to select which rating system to be used for the Summary Section. Once everything has been filled in, click on the Save button. ⚠️ Please refer to this article on how to create a rating system: Create and Manage Rating Systems 4. The new summary section has now been created. Attention: ⚠️ Every appraisal must have a Summary Section as it displays the final rating, as well as allows an employee or manager to add in final comments. The managers, approvers and employees can provide comments in the planning, approval and scoring phases. Return to table of contents Ratings and Comments Display Settings 1. Go to Administration &gt; Performance and click \"Appraisal Setup\". 2. Along the template title click the \"Appraisal Settings\" button. 3. Scroll down to the Appraisal Settings section. Employee can see manager score: When selected, the employee can see the overall final manager's rating once the rating has been entered during the 'Manager scoring phase' Overall Manager Rating Display: When the option 'After Appraisal is Finalised' is chosen, the overall manager's final rating will become visible only after the entire appraisal process is completed. On the other hand, if 'Manager Scoring Phase Finalised' is selected, the overall manager's final rating will be displayed after the manager submits the Manager Scoring Phase. Final Manager Comment Display: After comment is posted: the manager's comment will display after they save the comment. Manager Scoring Phase Finalised: the manager's comment will be displayed after the manager submits the 'Manager scoring phase. After Appraisal is Finalised: the manager's comment will be displayed after the appraisal status is marked as 'Complete' ⚠️ The sync function will go through all sections and sync data under Appraisal Settings to all related appraisals.

This means they have made a forgot password request or tried to log in incorrectly too many times. Steps Refer to your security settings to see how long the user will be locked out. If the user attempts to log in before the lock out interval is up with an incorrect password, they will continue to see the username or password is incorrect message If the user attempts to log in before the lock out interval is up with the correct password, they will see the Your account is temporarily locked message Run the Login Attempts Report in the Standard Reports step. This will show when they were locked out and therefore when they can try again i.e. when the lock out finishes. More system access troubleshooting tips can be found in this article.

                  "chunkText": "Introduction SSO (Single Sign On) lets users access Pivot Remuneration without manually logging in or having a separate password to manage. Users instead will automatically login by virtue of being logged in on your company's domain. Pivot Remuneration can be configured to work with SAML 2.0 Single Sign On (SSO) using your preferred identity provider. Setup and configuration can be managed directly by clients, with assistance from the Pivot Team when needed. System Administrator Requirements Before providing access to the company IT contact who will be setting up SSO the company System Administrator (working with Pivot to set up the system) will need to do the following to allow IT to log in and set up SSO: Please provide your internal IT contact who is configuring SSO with access to Pivot Remuneration: Create a user in your remuneration system for them and assign the System Administrator role with access to the Configure SSO and Issue User Access steps only Provide the IT user with the user login details for the system by issuing them user access Alongside 2, provide the manual link/url to access the site to set up SSO and until SSO is set up and confirmed as working. Other Requirements SSO will need to be setup by an IT Administrator with rights to add a new Relay Trust to your Identity Provider. IdP configuration details such as your IdP name and IdP SSO URL. Setting up SSO Steps Add a new Relay Trust for Pivot Remuneration. Add your IdP configuration to Pivot and gather the Pivot configuration information which will be provided on screen. Add this information to your new Relay Trust. At this point we recommend you test your SSO configuration without any signing or encryption enabled. This allows troubleshooting of the basic settings if needed. Once sign-in is working, enable your required signing and encryption settings. Pivot can provide a SHA-256 security certificate if required. SSO is now setup and working, you can enable/disable for your users as required.

This can help narrow down any issues that may arise. The “Login Attempts History” report under “Standard Reports” will provide useful information on login requests and why a request may have failed. You may need to liaise with your company System Administrator to download and review this report.
